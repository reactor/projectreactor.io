                        Reactor is <strong>fully non-blocking</strong> and provides
                        efficient demand management. It directly interacts with Java's
                        functional API, <code>CompletableFuture</code>, <code>Stream</code>, and <code>Duration</code>.

                <h1>Guardians of the Latency</h1>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0">Scaling out is an important tool for overcoming latency and slow microservices.
                    Cloud native apps and serverless functions have a better
                    chance at effective scale-out with asynchronous architectures.
                    To assist in asynchronous designs, Reactor offers non-blocking and
                    backpressure-ready network runtimes, including local
                    TCP/HTTP/UDP clients and servers, based on the robust <a
