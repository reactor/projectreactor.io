                <h1>Guardian of the Latency</h1>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0">Scaling-Out to overcome latency and slow microservices is an important
                    tool. Cloud Native apps will have a better chance at effective scale-out with asychronous architectures.
                    To assist such design, Reactor offers non-blocking and
                    backpressure-ready embeddable solutions including local and remote Unicast/Multicast
                    messaging
